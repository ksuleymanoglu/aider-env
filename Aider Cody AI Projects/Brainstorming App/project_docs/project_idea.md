I want to build an AI powered brainstorming and journaling app that helps users generate ideas, categorize them and provide additional content suggestions.

The app should allow users to create entries, tag them with categories and keywords, and generate summaries or related ideas using AI.

This will be a personal productivity tool that will help users organize and expand on their thouughts.

I want to keep this app simple. It should only provide the features I've described above.

It should not need to communicate with any external services, such as remote databases or APIs.
